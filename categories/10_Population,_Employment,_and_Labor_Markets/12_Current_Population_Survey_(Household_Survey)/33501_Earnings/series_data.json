The FLSA was generally only applicable to employees involved in interstate commerce, either directly or through the creation of goods. Many amendments have since been added to the FLSA, expanding its coverage and raising the minimum wage. Significant amendments occurred in 1961 and in 1966, when a separate minimum wage for farm workers was established. Starting in January of 1978 the minimum wages of all eligible workers, including farm workers, were made uniform. The values in the series for non-farm workers are those for the groups initially covered under the 1938 FLSA. Many states also have minimum wage laws. Some state laws provide greater employee protections; employers must comply with both.\n\nFor additional information go to: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/coverage.htm or http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm#fn3"

Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, or other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term \"usual\" is determined by each respondent's own understanding of the term. If the respondent asks for a definition of \"usual,\" interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.

Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week.

If the respondent asks for a definition of \"usual,\" interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.

Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, or other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term \"usual\" is determined by each respondent's own understanding of the term. If the respondent asks for a definition of \"usual,\" interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.

Prior to 1994, respondents were asked how much they usually earned per week. Since January 1994, respondents have been asked to identify the easiest way for them to report earnings (hourly, weekly, biweekly, twice monthly, monthly, annually, or other) and how much they usually earn in the reported time period. Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly are converted to a weekly equivalent. The term \"usual\" is determined by each respondent's own understanding of the term. If the respondent asks for a definition of \"usual,\" interviewers are instructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 or 5 months.
