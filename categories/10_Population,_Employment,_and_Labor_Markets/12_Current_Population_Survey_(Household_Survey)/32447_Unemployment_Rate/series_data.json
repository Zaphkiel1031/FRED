The current month's women worker ratio, thus, is estimated and then multiplied by the all-employee estimate. The weighted-difference-link-and-taper formula (described in the source) is used to estimate the current month's women worker ratio. This formula adds the change in the matched sample's women worker ratio (the weighted-difference link) to the prior month's estimate, which has been slightly modified to reflect changes in the sample composition (the taper).\n\nThe series comes from the 'Current Population Survey (Household Survey)'\n\nThe source code is: LNU04000062"
