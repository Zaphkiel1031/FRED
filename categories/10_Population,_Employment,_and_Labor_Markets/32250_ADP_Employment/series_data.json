This is a recurring process that happens every year, and is a common practice for reports of this nature.\n\nIn addition to this regular, annual update, the NER weighting methodology was revised to facilitate an easier comparison of total employment estimates between the NER and QCEW; monthly aggregates now leverage weekly seasonal adjustments rather than a separate monthly seasonal adjustment; and the national aggregate is now constructed from industry aggregates. There was also a refinement in the labeling methodology which is used to determine how various employment sources fall into a particular industry and geography definitions. These changes were applied retroactively to the 13-year history of the NER."
