Each employed person is counted only once, even if he or she holds more than one job.\n\nUnemployed persons are all persons who had no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment some time during the 4 week-period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.\n\nFor more details, see the release's <a href=https://www.bls.gov/lau/laufaq.htm>frequently asked questions</a>."

Each employed person is counted only once, even if he or she holds more than one job.\n\nUnemployed persons are all persons who had no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment some time during the 4 week-period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.\n\nThe unemployment rate is the unemployed percent of the civilian labor force [100 times (unemployed/civilian labor force)].\n\nFor more details, see the release's <a href=https://www.bls.gov/lau/laufaq.htm>frequently asked questions</a>."

Each employed person is counted only once, even if he or she holds more than one job.\n\nUnemployed persons are all persons who had no employment during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment some time during the 4 week-period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.\n\nFor more details, see the release's <a href=https://www.bls.gov/lau/laufaq.htm>frequently asked questions</a>."

Currently, Average Earning Assets is computed as the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Trading Assets (call item RCFD3545); Total Held-to-Maturity Securities (call item RCFD1754); Total Amortized Cost of Available-For-Sale Securities (call item RCFD1772); Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987); Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989).\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis includes the sum of Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987) and Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989) in lieu of call item RCFD1350 (Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs)) beginning in the first quarter of 2002.\n\nBefore 1993 the Average Earning Assets was the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs) (call item RCFD1350); Total Investment Securities at Book Value (call item RCFD0390); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Assets Held in Trading Accounts (call item RCFD2146).\n\nGeographic location is determined by Abbreviated State Name, 'IL' (call item RSSD9200), and Federal Reserve District, '08' (call item RSSD9170). Abbreviated State Name, 'IL' (call item RSSD9200), represents the two character state abbreviation for Illinois. The Federal Reserve District, '08' (call item RSSD9170), represents the St. Louis Federal Reserve District.\n\nUsers are advised to use the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' data dictionary (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/data-dictionary) to retrieve detailed information for specific call items."

The source provides this data at https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/.\n\nTax-adjusted income is the sum of Net Interest Income (call item RIAD4074) and annualized Income/Loss before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Items and Other Adjustments (call item RIAD4301), which is multiplied by the corresponding tax rate based on the annual income level. Currently, Average Earning Assets is computed as the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Trading Assets (call item RCFD3545); Total Held-to-Maturity Securities (call item RCFD1754); Total Amortized Cost of Available-For-Sale Securities (call item RCFD1772); Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987); Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989).\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis includes the sum of Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987) and Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989) in lieu of call item RCFD1350 (Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs)) beginning in the first quarter of 2002.\n\nBefore 1993 the Average Earning Assets was the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs) (call item RCFD1350); Total Investment Securities at Book Value (call item RCFD0390); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Assets Held in Trading Accounts (call item RCFD2146).\n\nGeographic location is determined by Abbreviated State Name, 'MS' (call item RSSD9200), and Federal Reserve District, '08' (call item RSSD9170). Abbreviated State Name, 'MS' (call item RSSD9200), represents the two character state abbreviation for Mississippi.

Additional consolidated data is available on the FDIC's Bank Data and Statistics (https://www.fdic.gov/bank/statistical/).\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis calculates this annualized series as the ratio of Tax-Adjusted Income to Average Earning Assets using raw data as collected by the FFIEC. The source provides this data at https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/.\n\nTax-adjusted income is the sum of Net Interest Income (call item RIAD4074) and annualized Income/Loss before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Items and Other Adjustments (call item RIAD4301), which is multiplied by the corresponding tax rate based on the annual income level. Currently, Average Earning Assets is computed as the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Trading Assets (call item RCFD3545); Total Held-to-Maturity Securities (call item RCFD1754); Total Amortized Cost of Available-For-Sale Securities (call item RCFD1772); Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987); Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989).\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis includes the sum of Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987) and Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989) in lieu of call item RCFD1350 (Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs)) beginning in the first quarter of 2002.\n\nBefore 1993 the Average Earning Assets was the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs) (call item RCFD1350); Total Investment Securities at Book Value (call item RCFD0390); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Assets Held in Trading Accounts (call item RCFD2146).\n\nGeographic location is determined by Abbreviated State Name, 'TN' (call item RSSD9200), and Federal Reserve District, '08' (call item RSSD9170). Abbreviated State Name, 'TN' (call item RSSD9200), represents the two character state abbreviation for Tennessee. The Federal Reserve District, '08' (call item RSSD9170), represents the St. Louis Federal Reserve District.\n\nUsers are advised to use the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' data dictionary (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/data-dictionary) to retrieve detailed information for specific call items."
