        "notes": "Overview of the Index\nThe Index is a quarterly comprehensive picture of the average American household\u2019s financial condition. Built by assessing the key elements of financial health and distress, it converts a complex set of factors into a single, easy to understand number.\n\nScope and History\nThe index measures the U.S., all 50 states and more than 70 MSAs. The national and state versions date back to 1980 and the MSA versions date back to 1990.\n\nPublic Data and Proprietary Methodology\nWe use more than 65 data points from government, public and private data and a proprietary methodology for compiling, combining and evaluating data. With nearly 50 years of experience and insight into helping consumers in financial distress, we know the biggest causes of distress, how people react to financial challenges and proven strategies for regaining control. (Note: Our client data is not a data source for the Index)\n\nMeasured on a 100 Point Scale\nFinancial distress is measured on a 100 point scale and a score under 70 indicates financial distress. The lower the score equals more distress, a weaker financial position, more urgency to act, takes longer and is harder to resolve, and increases the probability of needing a third party help to resolve.\n\nThe Index score is tied to one of 5 general rating categories, which reflect the strength and stability of the consumer\u2019s position.\nLess than 60 Emergency / Crisis\n60 \u2013 69 Distressed / Unstable\n70 \u2013 79 Weakening / At-Risk\n80 \u2013 89 Good / Stable\n90 and Above Excellent / Secure\n\nWhat Does the Index Measure?\nWe measure the 5 categories of personal finance that reflect or lead to a secure, stable financial life\u2014Employment, Housing, Credit, Household Budget and Net Worth. All are equally important, so have given each category equal weighting.\n\nEmployment. Stable income is the foundation of any family\u2019s finances. This category measures the impact of unemployment and underemployment on financial health.\nKey Measures: Unemployment, Underemployment\nSample Data Source: Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nHousing. Safe, affordable housing is a priority for all families. This category measures how consumers are paying their mortgage/rent and the impact of housing costs on their finances.\nKey Measures: Mortgage and Rental Delinquencies, Housing as Percent of Budget\nSample Data Source: National Delinquency Survey\n\nCredit. Responsible use of credit creates more borrowing options and lower costs. This category assesses the strength of credit scores and how well families manage their credit.\nKey Measures: Credit Scores, Trade Line Utilization, Credit Delinquencies, Per Capita Bankruptcies\nSample Data Source: National Credit Bureau\n\nHousehold Budget. Spending less than you make is the daily choice that leads to long-term success. This category measures families\u2019 spending patterns and saving for emergencies.\nKey Measures: Disposable Income, Savings, Consumer Confidence\nSample Data Source: Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nNet Worth. Strong, positive net worth creates options and independence. This category measures how well consumers are strengthening their personal balance sheets.\nKey Measures: Household Net Worth, Net Worth versus Funds Required for Long-Term Needs (e.g. retirement)\nSample Data Source: Federal Reserve Flow of Funds, Survey of Consumer Finances"

The series may be incomplete due to various limitations in price reporting during the sample period. Available prices were reported for seven-day intervals prior to January 1862 and for ten-day intervals afterwards. The New York Times' summary of daily trading on the New York Stock Exchange was used to complete the series in the best possible manner. The New York Times-reported price that occurred closest to but not beyond the date listed in the Bankers'Magazine was used.\n\nOne should not infer the maturity or the issue dates of the bonds from the available prices. The holding period yields or yields to maturity imputed from this data should be interpreted with caution. Such information must be sought from other sources on state finances."

Indeed seasonally adjusts each series based on historical patterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Each series, including the national trend, occupational sectors, and sub-national geographies, is seasonally adjusted separately. Indeed switched to this new methodology in January 2021 and now reports all historical data using this new methodology. Historical numbers have been revised and may differ significantly from originally reported values. The new methodology applies a detrended seasonal adjustment factor to the percentage change in job postings.

The Census Bureau has changed the methodology for computing median income over time. The Census Bureau has computed medians using either Pareto interpolation or linear interpolation. Currently, we are using linear interpolation to estimate all medians. Pareto interpolation assumes a decreasing density of population within an income interval, whereas linear interpolation assumes a constant density of population within an income interval. The Census Bureau calculated estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1979 through 1987 using Pareto interpolation if the estimate was larger than $20,000 for people or $40,000 for families and households. This is because the width of the income interval containing the estimate is greater than $2,500.\n\nWe calculated estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1976, 1977, and 1978 using Pareto interpolation if the estimate was larger than $12,000 for people or $18,000 for families and households. This is because the width of the income interval containing the estimate is greater than $1,000. All other estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1976 through 2011 (2012 ASEC) and almost all of the estimates of median income and associated standard errors for 1975 and earlier were calculated using linear interpolation.\n\nThus, use caution when comparing median incomes above $12,000 for people or $18,000 for families and households for different years. Median incomes below those levels are more comparable from year to year since they have always been calculated using linear interpolation. For an indication of the comparability of medians calculated using Pareto interpolation with medians calculated using linear interpolation, see Series P-60, Number 114, Money Income in 1976 of Families and Persons in the United States (www2.census.gov/prod2/popscan/p60-114.pdf)."

In addition to these federal programs, state and local programs use the income and poverty estimates for distributing funds and managing programs.\n\nHousehold income includes income of the householder and all other people 15 years and older in the household, whether or not they are related to the householder. Median is the point that divides the household income distributions into two halves: one-half with income above the median and the other with income below the median. The median is based on the income distribution of all households, including those with no income.\n\nA confidence interval is a range of values, from the lower bound to the respective upper bound, that describes the uncertainty surrounding an estimate. A confidence interval is also itself an estimate. It is made using a model of how sampling, interviewing, measuring, and modeling contribute to uncertainty about the relation between the true value of the quantity we are estimating and our estimate of that value. The \"90%\" in the confidence interval listed above represents a level of certainty about our estimate. If we were to repeatedly make new estimates using exactly the same procedure (by drawing a new sample, conducting new interviews, calculating new estimates and new confidence intervals), the confidence intervals would contain the average of all the estimates 90% of the time. For more details about the confidence intervals and their interpretation, see this explanation (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/guidance/confidence-intervals.html)."

The median is based on the income distribution of all households, including those with no income.\n\nA confidence interval is a range of values, from the lower bound to the respective upper bound, that describes the uncertainty surrounding an estimate. A confidence interval is also itself an estimate. It is made using a model of how sampling, interviewing, measuring, and modeling contribute to uncertainty about the relation between the true value of the quantity we are estimating and our estimate of that value. The \"90%\" in the confidence interval listed above represents a level of certainty about our estimate. If we were to repeatedly make new estimates using exactly the same procedure (by drawing a new sample, conducting new interviews, calculating new estimates and new confidence intervals), the confidence intervals would contain the average of all the estimates 90% of the time. For more details about the confidence intervals and their interpretation, see this explanation (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/guidance/confidence-intervals.html)."

The source provides this data at https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/.\n\nTax-adjusted income is the sum of Net Interest Income (call item RIAD4074) and annualized Income/Loss before Income Taxes and Extraordinary Items and Other Adjustments (call item RIAD4301), which is multiplied by the corresponding tax rate based on the annual income level. Currently, Average Earning Assets is computed as the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Trading Assets (call item RCFD3545); Total Held-to-Maturity Securities (call item RCFD1754); Total Amortized Cost of Available-For-Sale Securities (call item RCFD1772); Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987); Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989).\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis includes the sum of Federal Funds Sold (call item RCONB987) and Securities Purchased Under Agreement to Resell (call item RCFDB989) in lieu of call item RCFD1350 (Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs)) beginning in the first quarter of 2002.\n\nBefore 1993 the Average Earning Assets was the sum of Interest-Bearing Balances (call item RCFD0071); Federal Funds Sold and Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell in Domestic Offices of the Bank and of Its Edge and Agreement Subsidiaries, and in International Banking Facilities(IBFs) (call item RCFD1350); Total Investment Securities at Book Value (call item RCFD0390); Total Loans and Leases, Net of Unearned Income (call item RCFD2122); Total Assets Held in Trading Accounts (call item RCFD2146).\n\nGeographic location is determined by Abbreviated State Name, 'NC' (call item RSSD9200), the two character state abbreviation for North Carolina.\n\nUsers are advised to use the Federal Reserve Board of Governors' data dictionary (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/data-dictionary) to retrieve detailed information for specific call items."
