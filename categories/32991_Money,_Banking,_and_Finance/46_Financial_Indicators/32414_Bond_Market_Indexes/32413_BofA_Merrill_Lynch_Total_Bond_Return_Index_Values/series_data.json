        "notes": "This data represents the ICE BofA US Corporate Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US\ndomestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

        "notes": "The ICE BofA Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index tracks the performance of US dollar (USD) and Euro denominated emerging markets non-sovereign debt publicly issued within the major domestic and Eurobond markets. To qualify for inclusion in the index, the issuer of debt must have risk exposure to countries other than members of the FX G10 (US, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Sweden, UK, Switzerland, Norway, and Euro Currency Members), all Western European countries, and territories of the US and Western European countries. Each security must also be denominated in USD or Euro with a time to maturity greater than 1 year and have a fixed coupon. For inclusion in the index, investment grade rated bonds of qualifying issuers must have at least 250 million (Euro or USD) in outstanding face value, and below investment grade rated bonds must have at least 100 million (Euro or USD) in outstanding face value. The index includes corporate and quasi-government debt of qualifying countries, but excludes sovereign and supranational debt. Other types of securities acceptable for inclusion in this index are: original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued in the US domestic bond markets as well the Eurobond Market simultaneously), 144a securities, pay-in-kind securities (includes toggle notes), callable perpetual securities (qualify if they are at least one year from the first call date), fixed-to-floating rate securities (qualify if the securities are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security). Defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of US mortgage pass-throughs and US structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for US mortgage pass-through and US structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until\nthe end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

Defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding times the market price plus accrued interest, subject to a 10% country of risk cap and a 2% issuer cap. Countries and issuers that exceed the limits are reduced to 10% and 2%, respectively, and the face value of each of their bonds is adjusted on a pro-rata basis. Similarly, the face values of bonds of all other countries and issuers that fall below their respective caps are increased on a pro-rata basis. In the event there are fewer than 10 countries in the Index, or fewer than 50 issuers, each is equally weighted and the face values of their respective bonds are increased or decreased on a pro-rata basis.

        "notes": "This data represents the ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index value, which tracks the performance of Euro denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the euro domestic or eurobond markets. Qualifying securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch). Qualifying securities must have at least one year remaining term to maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of Euro 100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and euro domestic markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Defaulted, warrant-bearing and euro legacy currency securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until\nthe end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

        "notes": "This data represents the ICE BofA US High Yield Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.
