The price levels are determined by the average prices paid by consumers for the mix of goods and services consumed in each region. Taking the ratio of RPPs shows the difference in price levels across regions.\n\nGoods refer to durable and nondurable consumption goods used in the estimation of the RPPs. Goods categories include apparel, education, food, housing, medical, recreation, transportation, and other goods. \n\nNonmetropolitan portion consists of all counties in a state or the US that are outside of metropolitan statistical areas. \n\nFor more information about this release go to http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/rpp/rpp_newsrelease.htm or http://www.bea.gov/regional/methods.cfm."
