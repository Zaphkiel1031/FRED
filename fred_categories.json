Among these are: \r\nThe household survey includes agricultural workers, the self- employed, unpaid family workers, and private household workers among the employed. These groups are excluded from the establishment survey. \r\nThe household survey includes people on unpaid leave among the employed. The establishment survey does not. \r\nThe household survey is limited to workers 16 years of age and older. The establishment survey is not limited by age. \r\nThe household survey has no duplication of individuals, because individuals are counted only once, even if they hold more than one job. In the establishment survey, employees working at more than one job and thus appearing on more than one payroll are counted separately for each appearance. \r\n\r\nFor more information, visit http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.tn.htm."
